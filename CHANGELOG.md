## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Keyword-Based Detection**: Detect pi extensions without conventional naming:
  - `PI_KEYWORDS` exported constant: `["pi-coding-agent", "pi-extension", "pi-package"]`
  - `hasPiExtensionKeyword()` reads package.json and checks for pi keywords
  - `getKeywordOnlyPackages()` auto-discovers packages via npm list + keyword scan
  - Enhanced `isGlobalPiInstall()` with `knownKeywordPackages` parameter
  - Settings persistence for discovered keyword-only packages
  - Comprehensive test coverage (new `test/keyword-detection.test.ts`)
  - Scoped `-pi` suffix detection tests added to `npm-guard.test.ts` and `regex.test.ts`

This enables detection of packages like `@touchskyer/memex` and `context-mode`
that are pi extensions but don't use `pi-*` or `*-pi` naming conventions.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Schema Validation**: Strict validation with migration path for legacy backups:
  - New backups include `$schema` field with versioned URL
  - `validatePackageSnapshot()` for comprehensive backup validation
  - `isLegacyBackup()` to detect pre-schema backups
  - `migrateLegacyBackup()` to upgrade legacy backups with user consent
  - Migration UI prompts during restore workflow
  - 52 new tests covering validation and migration scenarios
- **JSON Schema**: `schema/package-snapshot.json` for external validation

### Changed

- **Backup Format**: Simplified schema with `$schema` field for future-proofing:
  - Removed `registeredPackages` and `unregisteredPackages` (derived fields)
  - Only `npmPackages` array is stored (canonical source of truth)
  - Registration state computed at restore time from current pi settings
- **Restore Workflow**: Enhanced to detect and migrate legacy backups
- **i18n**: Added `restore.all_installed` key for simplified schema restore flow

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **Naming**: Renamed core types for semantic clarity:
  - `PackageDiff` → `PackageStatus` (with `@deprecated` alias for backward compatibility)
  - `GuardConfig` → `ExtensionSettings` (with `@deprecated` alias)
  - `BackupData` → `PackageSnapshot` (with `@deprecated` alias)
  - `syncOrphanedPackages()` → `registerPackages()`
  - `analyzePackages()` → `checkRegistrationStatus()`
  - `orphaned` → `unregistered` throughout codebase and documentation
- **Documentation**: Complete reorganization:
  - Split monolithic docs into 5 epics with user stories and acceptance criteria
  - Created `user-guides/` for task-oriented documentation
  - Created `reference/` for technical lookup
  - Created `development/` for contributor documentation
  - Added architecture decisions document (naming RFC)
  - Cleaned up archive/ to retain only essential historical docs

### Added

- **Test coverage**: 104 new tests across 5 suites:
  - `session-start.test.ts` - Startup detection and package analysis
  - `npm-guard.test.ts` - NPM install interception patterns
  - `restore-workflow.test.ts` - Selective restore operations
  - `gist-operations.test.ts` - Gist create/delete/sync
  - `menu-navigation.test.ts` - Menu UI navigation and help display
- **Documentation**: 32 new documentation files with traceability mapping

### Fixed

- **Test coverage**: Addressed all 5 documented coverage gaps from traceability matrix
- **Documentation**: i18n key migration guide added to contributing docs

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **i18n**: Handle empty string in select expressions correctly
- **i18n**: Process nested interpolations in select expressions properly
- **Security**: `isValidGistId()` now requires minimum 32-character hex strings to prevent empty string bypass
- **Security**: `isValidBackupPath()` now uses `resolve()` instead of `join()` for proper path traversal prevention
- **Validation**: Added `isBackupData()` type guard for comprehensive backup data validation
- **Performance**: Added 5-second TTL cache to `getNpmGlobalPackages()` to prevent UI blocking during menu loops
- **Code quality**: Improved `syncOrphanedPackages()` with Set-based normalization to prevent duplicate formats
- **Cleanup**: Replaced single-file temp cleanup with isolated `mkdtempSync()` directories for atomic cleanup
- **DX**: Added `process.env.DEBUG` conditional logging for npm operation failures

### Added

- **API**: Exported `isBackupData` type guard in public API (`extensions/api.ts`)

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- **i18n**: Correct ICU MessageFormat nested brace parsing bug where plural expressions showed literal text like "other {packages}}" instead of proper plural forms
- **Performance**: O(n²) → O(n) using sticky regex instead of string slicing in `formatMessage()`
- **Code quality**: Deduplicated `parsePluralOptions`/`parseSelectOptions` into shared `parseIcuOptions` implementation

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **i18n**: Removed 3 unused translation keys (`backup.gist_failed`, `config.path_default`, `config.gist_not_configured`) that were defined but never used
- **Testing**: Fixed i18n key validation regex to correctly parse translation keys and avoid false positives from string content

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Security validation**: `isValidGistId()` and `isValidBackupPath()` functions for preventing command injection and path traversal attacks
- **Pattern exports**: `NPM_GLOBAL_PATTERN`, `PI_PACKAGE_PATTERN`, and `isGlobalPiInstall()` exported for testing
- **Testing API**: Documented all exported test functions in CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Security documentation**: Added "Security Features" section to USAGE.md

### Changed

- **Lean test suite**: Refactored from 390 to 179 tests with equivalent coverage
- **i18n key**: Added `restore.invalid_path` translation key for security validation

### Fixed

- **Documentation**: Corrected test count references (100 → 179) across AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md
- **Documentation**: Updated AGENTS.md last updated date and test file organization
- **Documentation**: Added i18n technical details to CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Linting**: Fixed template literal issue in `isValidBackupPath()`
- **CHANGELOG**: Added missing version compare links for [0.5.0] and [0.6.0]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Documentation i18n**: Restructured docs into `docs/en-US/` with full localization support

- **Translation tests**: 154 tests validating all translation keys are valid and used
- **Contributing guide**: New translation contribution workflow in `docs/en-US/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Zero dependencies**: Custom ~2KB i18n engine, no external libraries needed
